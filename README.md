# EJ-pylib
Library of Python functions for importing

Here is a rundown of the names of Python functions that are included in each .py file.

Also below I will have a list of future ones I plan to add

Current functions included:

Spatial calculations (spatial_calcs.py)
  
	Haversine formula
	Hypotenuse formula
	Bearing formula
	
Data manipulation (data_manipulation.py)

	Select a subset of data
	Temperature gradient calculation
	
Cyclone phase space calculations (cps_calcs.py)

	Thickness asymmetry (B)
	Upper tropospheric thermal wind (Vut)
	Lower tropospheric thermal wind (Vlt)
	24-hr running mean (smoothed)
	
Conversion of .mat to .nc files (mat_to_nc.py)

Conversion from Cartesian to polar coordinates (cartesian_to_polar.py)
	
Future scripts to include:

	TC-specific calculations
	Plotting functions
